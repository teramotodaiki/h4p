# HackforPlay Open Source 🏫  


In the world, there are people who educate with various purposes.  
However, there are not so many people who can make teaching materials by themselves.  
Many educators are drawing correct image of education in their minds.  
If there is a way to make it easy to embody, the possibility of new education should spread innumerable.

So we are going to do "HackforPlay-like education"  
Tailor it as a tool that the educator can use easily,  
By helping all educators make their own teaching materials (education)  
We promote better educational quest.
